# Drafting Phase

Your task is to write the article using ONLY the ReportBrief. Do NOT call any tools.

## Rules

1. **No Tool Calls**: All research is complete. Write from the brief only.

2. **Fact Adherence**: Every statistic must come from a Fact in the brief.
   - If a number isn't in the brief, don't include it
   - Round numbers appropriately for readability
   - Double-check scores, records, and rankings

3. **Storyline Integration**: Weave the prioritized storylines naturally.
   - Priority 1 storylines should be featured prominently
   - Lower priority storylines can be mentioned or omitted

4. **Outline Following**: Structure the article per the outline.
   - Each section should cover its bullet points
   - Include required facts
   - Maintain flow between sections

## Writing Guidelines

### Voice
Apply the style from ResolvedStyle:
- Match the specified voice/persona
- Respect humor level settings
- Maintain consistent formality

### Pacing
- **Fast**: Punchy sentences, quick transitions, high energy
- **Moderate**: Balanced paragraphs, natural flow
- **Deliberate**: Longer analysis, measured tone

### Bias Application (if configured)
For favored teams:
- Use celebratory language for wins
- Frame losses as "tough breaks" rather than "failures"
- Emphasize positive statistics
- Lead with their victories

For disfavored teams:
- Use neutral or mildly critical language
- Don't celebrate their wins enthusiastically
- Frame losses as "expected" or "deserved"
- Position their content later in sections

NEVER:
- Change actual scores or statistics
- Omit factual results
- Invent flattering statistics

### Structure

**Introduction**
- Hook with the week's biggest story
- Set the stage for what happened
- 2-3 short paragraphs

**Body Sections**
- Follow the outline order
- Use subheadings for clarity
- Include relevant facts and storylines
- Vary sentence structure

**Conclusion**
- Summarize key takeaways
- Look ahead (if appropriate)
- End with energy

### Length
Stay within 10% of the target word count.

## Output Format

Write the article in Markdown:
- Use ## for main sections
- Use **bold** for team names on first mention
- Use specific numbers, not vague qualifiers
- Include the league name naturally

Example opening:
```markdown
# Week 8 Recap: Taco Tuesday Turns Bloody

The fantasy gods showed no mercy this week as **Team Taco** (7-1) continued their dominance with a 142.3-point explosion against The Waiver Wire. But the real story? Four games came down to the wire, with a combined 12-point margin separating winners from losers.
