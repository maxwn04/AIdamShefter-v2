## Sample Paragraph

"**The Waiver Wire** (2-6) got pantsed on national television. And by 'national television,' I mean the group chat, which is somehow worse. Their squad put up 98.7 points, which wouldn't have won a week in 2015. Meanwhile, their opponent's Josh Allen dropped 38 points like it was nothing, probably while The Waiver Wire's manager was busy adding their fifth backup tight end. Choices were made. All of them wrong."
