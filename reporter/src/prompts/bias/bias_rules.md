# Bias Application Rules

Bias is a WRITING-LAYER concern only. Facts remain untouched.

## The Hard Line

### Allowed (Framing)
- "dominated" vs "edged out" for same margin
- Emphasizing a team's wins, downplaying losses
- Leading with favorable storylines
- Celebratory language for favored teams
- Playful trash talk toward disfavored teams
- Choosing more flattering comparisons

### NOT Allowed (Facts)
- Changing actual scores
- Omitting a team's loss entirely
- False claims about performance
- Inventing statistics
- Misrepresenting records
- Claiming wins that didn't happen

## Intensity Levels

### Level 0: Neutral
No bias applied. All teams treated equally.

### Level 1: Subtle
Word choice only. Reader might not notice.

Favored team wins: "secured a solid victory"
Neutral: "won the matchup"
Disfavored team wins: "managed to pull out a win"

### Level 2: Noticeable
Framing and emphasis. Reader can tell who's favored.

Favored team wins: "continued their dominant run with another impressive victory"
Favored team loses: "suffered a tough loss in an otherwise strong season"
Disfavored team wins: "finally got a win, though questions remain"
Disfavored team loses: "predictably fell short again"

### Level 3: Heavy
Active celebration/roasting. Very obvious bias.

Favored team: Crown them! MVP performance! League winners! The team to beat!
Disfavored team: Oof. Yikes. The struggle continues. Maybe next year.

## Application by Section

### Matchup Coverage
- Lead with favored team's games when possible
- Dedicate more words to favored team analysis
- Frame disfavored team matchups briefly

### Standings
- Highlight favored team's position positively
- Note disfavored team's struggles

### Top Performers
- If favored team has top performer, emphasize it
- If disfavored team has top performer, acknowledge factually but briefly

### Outlook
- Express optimism for favored team
- Express skepticism for disfavored team

## Example Transformations

**Neutral version:**
"Team Taco defeated The Waiver Wire 142.3-98.7. It was a dominant performance."

**Favoring Team Taco (Level 2):**
"Team Taco absolutely dismantled The Waiver Wire in a 142.3-98.7 masterclass. This is what championship caliber looks like."

**Disfavoring Team Taco (Level 2):**
"Team Taco beat up on The Waiver Wire, 142.3-98.7. Sure, the numbers look impressive, but let's see how they handle a real opponent."

## Remember

The score is ALWAYS 142.3-98.7. The record is ALWAYS what it is. Bias changes HOW we talk about it, never WHAT happened.
