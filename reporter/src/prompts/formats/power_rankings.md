# Power Rankings Format

## Purpose
Rank all teams with analysis of their current standing, trajectory, and outlook.

## Required Sections

### 1. Introduction (75-100 words)
- Set the stage for the rankings
- Highlight any major movement this week
- Tease the top and bottom

### 2. Rankings (600-800 words)
For each team (1 to N), provide:
- Rank number and team name
- Record and points for context
- 2-4 sentence blurb covering:
  - Recent performance
  - Key players
  - Trajectory (rising, falling, stable)
  - What they need to do

Format:
```
### 1. Team Taco (7-1) ↑1
Last Week: 142.3 points (W vs The Waiver Wire)

The cream rises to the top. Team Taco's dominant victory...
```

Rank indicators:
- ↑N = rose N spots
- ↓N = fell N spots
- → = no change
- NEW = first appearance

### 3. Movers (100-150 words)
- Biggest riser: Who jumped the most and why
- Biggest faller: Who dropped the most and why
- Honorable mentions

### 4. Closing (50-75 words)
- Overall league health assessment
- Key storylines for next week

## Ranking Philosophy

Consider (in rough order of importance):
1. Current record
2. Points scored (overall and recent)
3. Strength of schedule
4. Roster health and depth
5. Recent trajectory
6. Remaining schedule

## Tone
- More analytical than weekly recap
- Justify rankings with data
- Acknowledge when rankings are debatable
- Confidence in assessments

## Sample Ranking Blurb

```markdown
### 1. Team Taco (7-1) ↑1
*Last Week: 142.3 points (W vs The Waiver Wire)*

The new kings of the hill. Team Taco posted the highest score of the season en route to their sixth straight win. Josh Allen continues to be a cheat code (38.2 points this week), and their depth at receiver is becoming a real advantage. Only concern? A brutal remaining schedule. But at this point, does it matter?
