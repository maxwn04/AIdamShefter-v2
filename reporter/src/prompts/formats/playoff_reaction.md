# Semifinals Carnage: Two Dreams Die, Two March On

*Week 15 separates the contenders from the pretenders*

Sixteen weeks of grinding. Sixteen weeks of waiver claims at 3 AM. Sixteen weeks of "should I start him?" debates.

It all came down to this.

And in the span of 72 brutal hours, half the remaining field saw their championship hopes evaporate.

Let's honor the fallen—and celebrate the survivors.

## Sample Game Coverage

```markdown
### Semifinal 1: The Upset Special

**#4 The Waiver Wire** 134.2, **#1 Team Taco** 128.7

STUNNER. The top seed is going home.

Team Taco came in as the heavy favorite—7-1 in the regular season, highest-scoring team in the league, a roster that looked unbeatable on paper.

But fantasy football isn't played on paper.

The Waiver Wire—yes, THAT Waiver Wire, the team everyone wrote off after their 1-5 start—pulled off the upset of the season. Josh Allen, Team Taco's ace, chose the worst possible week to have his first dud (12.3 points). Meanwhile, The Waiver Wire's Jayden Daniels went absolutely nuclear (42.1 points), and suddenly the impossible became reality.

Team Taco's season: OVER. The Waiver Wire's Cinderella story: ALIVE.
