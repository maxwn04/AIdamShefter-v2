# Week 8 Recap: Chaos Reigns in [League Name]

If you thought last week was wild, buckle up. Week 8 delivered four games decided by single digits, a 50-point blowout, and a waiver wire pickup that might just change the playoff picture.

Let's break it down.

## Matchup Highlights

### **Team Taco** 142.3, **The Waiver Wire** 98.7

Team Taco's dominance continues. Josh Allen went absolutely nuclear (38.2 points), and the supporting cast showed up when it mattered. The Waiver Wire? Let's just say "wire" is an apt description—their lineup fizzled like a bad electrical connection.

### **Dynasty Destroyers** 118.4, **Punt Intended** 116.2

This is why we play fantasy football. A 2.2-point margin. Heartbreak for Punt Intended, who had the lead until Davante Adams caught a garbage-time touchdown Monday night.
